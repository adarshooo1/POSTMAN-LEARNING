13. Get books from the Postman Library API.

you can get all the books in the library by making a request to
GET :- https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books. (copy url)
Here, GET is the request method and the url is the request URL. We'll cover what that means soon - but first let's get our hands dirty with our first request!

# Make your first request
1. Create a new request by either clicking Add a request inside your new Collection, or hovering on your Collection, then clicking the three dots icon and "Add request"  
2. Name your request "get books". Set the request method to GET, and the request URL to GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books. Be sure to hit Save!
3. Send your request by clicking the Send button

#View the response

If everything goes well, you will see a response from the server in the lower half of Postman.

It should look something like this: a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response body that is an array of book objects. You can scroll down to see more books.

Now you can understand the request response pattern, which represents how computers communicate over a network. An API is the interface that lets us know what kind of response to expect when we make certain calls to a server. 

You made an HTTP GET request to https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books and received a response from the server.

Diagram of the request-response pattern. A client makes a request over a network to hit a server, which interprets the request, processes it, and sends back a response over the network

The client is the agent making a request. A client could be a browser or an application you have coded, for example. In our case Postman is the client because that's how we sent the request. 

The request is sent over a network to some server. In our case, we made a request over the public internet to a server located at the address https://library-api.postmanlabs.com. 

The server interpreted the request (GET /books) and sent the appropriate response over the network back to the Postman client: a list of books.
